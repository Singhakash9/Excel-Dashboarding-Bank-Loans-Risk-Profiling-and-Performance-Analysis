# Consumer Lending Risk & Performance Analysis (Excel-Based Project)

This project takes a deep dive into a real-world consumer lending dataset with the goal of improving how banks and financial institutions manage loan portfolios. Using Excel as the primary tool, I explored borrower behaviors, risk factors, and profitability patterns to help build data-backed recommendations for better decision-making.

## Project Overview

Managing a loan portfolio is all about balancing risk and return. The core objective here was to:

- Understand how income, loan amount, and other borrower features affect defaults
- Evaluate which loan types and segments are most profitable (or risky)
- Create an interactive Excel dashboard to visualize and summarize the insights

The end result? A dynamic workbook that does more than just show numbers â€” it helps make smarter decisions.

## Whatâ€™s Inside the Dataset?

The dataset includes over 30 fields across borrower details, loan characteristics, and repayment history. Some of the important columns:

- `loan_amount`, `annual_inc`, `interest_rate`, `dti`
- `loan_condition` (Good/Bad)
- `grade` (A to G risk levels)
- `purpose`, `region`, `application_type`
- Repayment values like `installment`, `total_pymnt`, and `recoveries`

## Core Analyses & Visuals

Here's a quick overview of what was analyzed:

- **Loan Amount vs Income Category**: Are high-income borrowers taking higher loans?
- **Region-wise Loan Distribution**: Which areas are borrowing the most?
- **Grade-wise DTI Trends**: How does risk change across loan grades?
- **Profitability Calculation**: Which loans returned the most (or least) value?
- **Loan Defaults**: Predicted defaults using income, employment length & loan size
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Three dashboards covering distribution, trends, and risk

## Key Insights

Here are a few takeaways:

- **87% of loans are performing well** â€“ but the remaining 13% represent a serious risk
- **Debt consolidation loans** top the defaulter list, followed by credit card refinancing
- **Grades E & F** show the highest average DTI â€” clear red flags
- **Small business loans**, surprisingly, offer great returns with relatively lower defaults
- Borrowers with **low income and high interest rates** make up the majority of defaults

## Dashboards Built

I created three Excel dashboards to present the data clearly:

- **Loan Distribution** â€“ Who's borrowing what, and where?

- **Trend Analysis** â€“ Loan patterns over time, by type and grade

- **Risk & Profit Dashboard** â€“ Which segments should banks watch out for?

Each dashboard includes slicers and filters to explore the data interactively.
